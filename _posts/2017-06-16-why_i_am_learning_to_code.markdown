A decision I made almost on a whim, because it just seemed right. It is the way the world is moving, and I want to understand more the framework that drives everything today from traffic lights to mobile phones. I also think it is a way to make the humanities more accessible to people and to create new ways of studying and writing history. That last part is the contribution I hope to make. 

After 8 years of graduate school it is strange to be doing something so different - task-oriented lessons with discrete landmarks and stopping points. I am also learning that it requires a re-framing of the mind to think like a machine that only understands what you put into it. It's very strange and confusing but also exciting.

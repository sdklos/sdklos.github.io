For the past few days I have been building my first self-directed project - a cli gem that outputs a list of unesco world heritage sites by type, and then outputs information about a particular user-selected site. I am surprised I was able to build something so complicated and figure it out myself. There are still a few things I could do to make it better - for example, I couldn't figure out how to keep a class variable static when the class is nested within a module. Also, there was a lot of code repeated that could probably be placed in a module. I'd like to come back to this at a later date, but I think at this point I will just submit the working code and see how my evaluation goes.

Although when I first learned about "scraping" I was extremely intimidated and confused, after this exercise I find it intimidating yet also very cool - I spent a lot of hours using pry to figure out how to get the scrape result I wanted - and there was something exciting about it.

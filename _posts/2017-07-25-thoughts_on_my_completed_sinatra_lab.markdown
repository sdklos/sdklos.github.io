it was interesting for me to compare the sinatra app I just completed with the cli gem I built a few weeks ago. What I found most exciting was the data aspect - for my web scraping gem, there was no new data being generated on my end - I was just taking information that already existed and manipulating it.

While my activerecord database, tables, and columns for this lab were quite complicated - and at the 11th hour I even realized that one of my data relationships was faulty, and had to completely remake a relationship from one of has many - belongs to, to one of has many through - it was so fun knowing that I my app was in fact building data and data relationships. Data is surely the element that separates dynamic web apps from static ones.
